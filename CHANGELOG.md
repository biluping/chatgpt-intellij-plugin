## [0.2.8]
+ Multiple bugfixes
+ Added setting to disable welcome message in the chat window
+ Added support for multiple contexts

With this new feature, users can select and include several code snippets from different files in a single chat prompt. A code snippet can be incorporated into the context by following these steps:

- Highlight a section of code within the editor, right-click on it, and select the "ChatGPT: Add to Context" option.
- If you wish to add the entire file to the context, simply choose the "ChatGPT: Add to Context" option without highlighting any code within the editor.
- Content of _document popups_ can be also added as a context. Just click the "More" button located in the bottom-right corner on the popup and select "ChatGPT: Add to Context" action.
- Multiple code snippets can be either added or removed before forwarding all snippets and a prompt to the chatbot.

## [0.2.7]
+ Added support for newest OpenAI '0613 models. Available now for selection from the Plugin Settings.

## [0.2.6]
